# 10.150.150.38 - PWNTILLDAWN WRITEUP

The following ports were found using rustscan

I served the ports to nmap and got found a http site

It was a jekins login page, i tried the usual default login pairs but none worked.

Decided to use hydra 

We got a hit!

Inputed the details and we have a dashboard now.
