# PwnTillDawn Online Battlefield

PwnTillDawn Online Battlefield is a penetration testing lab created by wizlynx group where participants can test their offensive security skills in a safe and legal environment, but also having fun! The goal is simple, break into as many machines as possible using a succession of weaknesses and vulnerabilities and collect flags to prove the successful exploitation. Each target machine that can be compromised contains at least one “FLAG” (most of the times a file and typically located in the user’s Desktop, or the user’s root directory).
